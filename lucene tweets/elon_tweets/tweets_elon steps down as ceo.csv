@theDetroitJames,Elon Musk hiring a WEF executive to be the new CEO of Twitter is like if Luke Skywalker hired Darth Vader to lead the Rebel Alliance. Its like having Hunter Biden head up a sex trafficking task force. Like Derek Jeter becoming Manager of the Red Sox. @elonmusk… WTF DUDE?!?,"May 12, 2023 · 11:22 AM UTC"

@akson_adam,This is a disaster. The WEF and its members aren't exactly known for advocating free-speech. I'm shocked Elon would appoint a member as CEO of Twitter :(,"May 12, 2023 · 9:03 AM UTC"

@ThebetterJD,It was 100% a shit show. CNN from what I hear is a lot like Twitter when Elon bought it. Everybody working there is complaining that the CEO has no idea what the fuck he’s doing and there’s nothing they can do about it because yay corporatism.,"May 12, 2023 · 7:51 AM UTC"

Elon Musk clearly doesn’t give a rat’s ass about small, nobody accounts being perpetually shadow banned and routinely suspended for stupid, ambiguous reasons.
