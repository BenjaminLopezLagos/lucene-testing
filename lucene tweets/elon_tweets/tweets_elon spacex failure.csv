@ReapersDream666,"I am always impressed by the rocket launches... I mean this one clearly didn't work.. separation fucked up.. but the best thing..

@TheCardNexus,Lol what fucking nonsense. They aren't launching today because it's 420 but Elon has made it clear his references to 420 are pot related and have been for years. There was literally a lawsuit over one of them.,"Apr 20, 2023 · 9:47 AM UTC"
