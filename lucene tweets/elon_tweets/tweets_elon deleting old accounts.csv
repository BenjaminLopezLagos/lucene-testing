@s1eepoBeepo,"while elon’s decision to delete inactive accounts is shitty to memorial accounts and ppl with lives outside of twitter, this does mean the sleepobeepo handle will be available since that account has been dead for a couple years already","May 12, 2023 · 9:58 PM UTC"
@writersflood,The thing that sucks about possibly taking breaks from twitter now is that Elon has made it so if your account is too inactive it gets removed,"May 12, 2023 · 5:52 PM UTC"
@TankControls,fuck the new inactive account rules and fuck elon,"May 12, 2023 · 5:33 PM UTC"

@astralb1rth,"If I do this, I’ll be back in july. Probably with a new account. Elon is being a dick meaning I cant go inactive as I get suspended","May 11, 2023 · 11:07 PM UTC"
@MrRiot21,"The fact Elon is going to suspend accounts for being inactive for only 30 days is not a great feature, as it basically forces us Twitter users to use the app on a monthly basis or else your account gets suspended.

It’s absolute bullshit, and disrespect to dead users on here.","May 11, 2023 · 10:38 PM UTC"

@WitchofSteam,"Gotta say @Twitter 's "" Inactive Account "" Policy Is the Latest in a Long line of Collosal Failures By Elon's Completely Inept leadership style.

@Hacko_dev,"Elon Musk plans to conduct Twitter's largest ever account purging. He  aims to clear out old, inactive accounts to free up unique usernames for  new users, especially those willing to pay for subscriptions.

I don't want to lose my 2019 account, that's why I'm tweeting here :)","May 9, 2023 · 5:40 PM UTC"
