@GMRaphi,"CW: Twitter, Musk, Birdsite policy

I will be honest, even with the Twitter API becoming a paid service in 2 weeks, Elon Musk is not destroying his 44 billion toy fast enough for me.

I mean it's a start but he really should do some ""hardcore"" ""radical"" ""10x"" strategy.","Feb 2, 2023 · 12:39 PM UTC"

@kearneymw,"I've been worried that Elon may restrict the free API but to be honest I didn't think abandoning it was in play. For a long time, Twitter and people like me said, ""make sure you keep and/or share the status IDs and you can rehydrate the data later."" Well, that will soon be a lie.","Feb 2, 2023 · 12:06 PM UTC"
