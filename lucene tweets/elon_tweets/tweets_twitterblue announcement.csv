@PatriotMikeNC,"Everyone should be paying attention to the source code @elonmusk dropped on placement algo's (how Twitter weights your content against others).

It's based (as of right now) almost solely on your follower-to-following ratio.   At 100/100 you have a weight of 1.0  At 50/100 you have a 0.5 and 100/50 you have a 1.5.

When someone promises a follow back and does not, your score is reduced and your content becomes less relevant - they steal your voice on Twitter.  Let that sink in.

Also check your follows, if you see a bunch of people that have withdrawn their follows from you, remove them immediately. 

There seems to be an exception to this rule though, actual ""celeb"" (assuming grey checks) have a far less rate of impact on your content.  You can follow as many grey checks as you want with minimum impact.

But to reiterate:  if you are following 100 people and only 10 follow you back, no one can see your content unless they specifically click your name.

Musk has promised to change this a little in the coming weeks by decreasing the relevancy of those who do not pay for Twitter Blue.","Mar 29, 2023 · 11:22 PM UTC"

@lorenzoridolfi,"A revolta do Guga Chacra em relação ao Twitter Blue representa bem os objetivos do Elon Musk quando modificou o significado do então cobiçado selinho.
Antes era o símbolo da elite selecionada a dedo pela ideologia nefasta esquerdista do Twitter. A verdadeira raça ariana do Twitter, que evidentemente só era concedida aos ""iluminados"" da esquerda. Os de pensamento divergente jamais seriam agraciados e provavelmente foram banidos da plataforma.
Hoje qualquer um que pague o valor estipulado pelo Twitter e possua um celular verificado pode ter o selinho azul. Não é nenhuma sinalização de virtude, apenas significa que você muito provavelmente não é um robô e seria uma pessoa de verdade. Nada mais do que isso. 
O pagamento ainda é uma questão controversa, pois obviamente afasta os que não podem pagar, mas é inegável que é um mecanismo eficaz para tornar o custo proibitivo de manter milhares de robôs falsos. 
Na minha opinião, o pagamento dá transparência sobre a origem dos recursos do Twitter e ajuda a reduzir o mindset a favor dos produtos online gratuitos que no final das contas pagamos um preço alto em liberdade e em privacidade.
Por fim, é um investimento que pessoalmente considero válido para fortalecer o Twitter e a liberdade expressão, que, por consequência, reduz o poder da mídia bastarda, um dos maiores cânceres da nossa sociedade.","Mar 29, 2023 · 12:40 PM UTC"

@ScottWAllen16,"Your choice:
.

The Washington Commanders for $6B or Twitter for $44B ?
.

Only one investment is likely to appreciate over time. One is a distressed property with potential for growth & the other a shiny overpriced toy with a popularity-time stamp.

@iamskamal_,"Dear Twitter CEO, @elonmusk @Twitter @TwitterGov @GlobalAffairs @TwitterNews @TwitterBlue 

I am writing to make a personal request that I believe would greatly benefit the Muslim community. While I understand that it may be too late to implement for this year's Ramadan, I strongly suggest that starting from next year, Twitter should introduce a Ramadan mode.

As you may know, during Ramadan, Muslims fast from sunrise to sunset and spend the month in prayer and reflection. However, it can be challenging for Muslims to browse through their Twitter timeline during this time as the content may not align with the spiritual values and themes of Ramadan.

Therefore, I suggest introducing a toggle button that users can switch to activate Ramadan mode. This mode would filter out content that is not relevant to Ramadan and focus solely on tweets related to Ramadan, such as spiritual reflections, charitable causes, and community events.

I believe that this feature would be greatly appreciated by the Muslim community and would demonstrate Twitter's commitment to inclusivity and diversity.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Alaya Kamal 

Kindly RT.
