@KvrisvMakise,"Not a fan of the pc slant of models like chatgpt but truthgpt is an awful name. There's statements with no truth value for example, like moral questions. And on controversial issues, who exactly decides what is truth and what the AI is trained on? The devs. Who can get shit wrong","Apr 18, 2023 · 12:48 AM UTC"
@Puterdiva101,And in this instance Thank God for Fox News. It’s amazing how little coverage the mainstream media gives AI. 60 minutes at a great program last night also.,"Apr 18, 2023 · 12:45 AM UTC"
@Puterdiva101,Great scary interview. I hope you are able to keep mankind intact. Opened my eyes as to how ruthless google and Microsoft are. Also scary how political groups are using AI to influence us. It will be hard to believe anything anymore.,"Apr 18, 2023 · 12:43 AM UTC"

@300_lines,Everyone I know who has more than zero clue about AI thinks Elon Musk is a huckster piece of shit good luck with TruthGPT ya fuckin loser,"Apr 18, 2023 · 12:40 AM UTC"
@h_hexxe,We need to get our shit together before we ever consider giving AI that kind of power.,"Apr 18, 2023 · 12:36 AM UTC"
@sara_cd_4,"Watching #ElonMusk & #TuckerCarlson discuss #AI is the most terrifying thing I’ve ever seen in my life!

Evil people are currently controlling AI and that should scare the shit out of everyone.
Including leftists.","Apr 18, 2023 · 12:36 AM UTC"
@AliAhmedYEM,"In a decade, artificial intelligence (AI) is poised to assume command of all devices and gain unrestricted entry to all computer systems.","Apr 18, 2023 · 12:32 AM UTC"
@sissyjo21951407,"Interesting interview. But, wait, aren't we all already in control by visual and vocal advertisements daily subliminally trancing people into believing its hype. AI could be just mismanaged, possibly uncontrolled actions, or not, at any time.  Sounds like Hal computer.","Apr 18, 2023 · 12:31 AM UTC"

@NickKayal,Fascinating conversation between @elonmusk and Tucker Carlson. This AI stuff is super interesting. America’s new fear porn.,"Apr 18, 2023 · 12:25 AM UTC"
@justRedX_,"In response to Elon Musk's TruthGPT, I will make an AI called CUMGPT, the CUM stands for Computers Under Me.","Apr 18, 2023 · 12:22 AM UTC"
@danimwallace,@elonmusk told @TuckerCarlson that Google co-founder Larry Page once called him a “speciesist” in advocating for humans and wants to build a “digital god” through AI #ArtificialIntelligence,"Apr 18, 2023 · 12:16 AM UTC"
@ingdamnit,Elon Musk promising new AI shit has the same tone and seriousness of my dad promising this time he'll stay sober and we'll be a real family,"Apr 18, 2023 · 12:15 AM UTC"
@ScanmyphotosC,"During his appearance on Tucker Carlson's show, Elon Musk discussed his views on regulations for rockets and cars, advocating for AI to be included in the mix. Musk: regulations tend to occur after something terrible happens. Interestingly, remained quiet on gun regulation","Apr 18, 2023 · 12:10 AM UTC"
@onenine90x,"All the media (Tucker Carlson included) shitting their pants cuz they're soon to be called out by AI 24/7. 😂

Honestly though, I don't think you can develop an AI to identify all the truths because truth is often not black & white. Humans try to paint a picture of certainty to help us from going crazy.","Apr 18, 2023 · 12:09 AM UTC"
@Dante7237,"Hey @elonmusk let me help.
#AI is exploitable and that is the root cause for all humanity to be concerned about its proliferation.","Apr 18, 2023 · 12:09 AM UTC"
@garycox24469568,"@elonmusk Thanks for helping people understand the AI situation and advocating a slow down and assessment period. If you need a theme song, may I suggest, The Last DJ, by Tom Petty. Thanks.","Apr 18, 2023 · 12:00 AM UTC"
