@PatriotMikeNC,"Everyone should be paying attention to the source code @elonmusk dropped on placement algo's (how Twitter weights your content against others).  It's based (as of right now) almost solely on your follower-to-following ratio.   At 100/100 you have a weight of 1.0  At 50/100 you have a 0.5 and 100/50 you have a 1.5.  When someone promises a follow back and does not, your score is reduced and your content becomes less relevant - they steal your voice on Twitter.  Let that sink in.  Also check your follows, if you see a bunch of people that have withdrawn their follows from you, remove them immediately.   There seems to be an exception to this rule though, actual ""celeb"" (assuming grey checks) have a far less rate of impact on your content.  You can follow as many grey checks as you want with minimum impact.  But to reiterate:  if you are following 100 people and only 10 follow you back, no one can see your content unless they specifically click your name.  Musk has promised to change this a little in the coming weeks by decreasing the relevancy of those who do not pay for Twitter Blue.",29/03/2023 23:22:00,4

@iamskamal_,"Dear Twitter CEO, @elonmusk @Twitter @TwitterGov @GlobalAffairs @TwitterNews @TwitterBlue   I am writing to make a personal request that I believe would greatly benefit the Muslim community. While I understand that it may be too late to implement for this year's Ramadan, I strongly suggest that starting from next year, Twitter should introduce a Ramadan mode.  As you may know, during Ramadan, Muslims fast from sunrise to sunset and spend the month in prayer and reflection. However, it can be challenging for Muslims to browse through their Twitter timeline during this time as the content may not align with the spiritual values and themes of Ramadan.  Therefore, I suggest introducing a toggle button that users can switch to activate Ramadan mode. This mode would filter out content that is not relevant to Ramadan and focus solely on tweets related to Ramadan, such as spiritual reflections, charitable causes, and community events.  I believe that this feature would be greatly appreciated by the Muslim community and would demonstrate Twitter's commitment to inclusivity and diversity.  Thank you for your consideration.  Sincerely,  Alaya Kamal   Kindly RT.   #Ramadan2023 #RamadanKareem",29/03/2023 12:13:00,4

@EllieFreedom4,"I happily signed up for Twitter Blue today. Yes, @Elon Musk has A LOT more money than me. ??But this hero paid $44 BILLION dollars to protect OUR free speech!   This was an altruistic act for a company that is now worth $20B  & he is now on the ""Shit List"" of very powerful & nasty people!  The Twitter files proved massive corruption that we all knew existed- but had NO PROOF of.    For me, paying monthly and STFU is the right thing to do! There is no reason we should bask in his good deeds without giving anything in return. It's a small price to pay to be able to speak freely in (at least) one public forum in this country where free speech is quickly eroding!! ?????? ????",29/03/2023 02:18:00,4
